detected.\n3. **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from the video at regular intervals (e.g., every 0.5 seconds).\n4. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify people in each frame.\n5. **Gender Classification**: Use a gender classification model to determine if the detected person is a woman.\n6. **Track Individuals**: Use tracking algorithms to ensure that the same person is not counted multiple times.\n7. **Count Women**: Sum up the number of unique women detected.\n8. **Output Result**: Format the result as a JSON list.\n\nHere is the JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video file into the processing environment.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 2,\n        \"description\":

This can be done using techniques like shot boundary detection.\n   - **Step 2.2**: Segment the video into scenes based on the detected boundaries.\n\n3. **Action Recognition**:\n   - **Step 3.1**: For each scene, use an action recognition model to identify actions occurring in the scene.\n   - **Step 3.2**: Specifically, look for the 'water sliding' action in each scene.\n\n4. **Counting Occurrences**:\n   - **Step 4.1**: Count the number of scenes where the 'water sliding' action is detected.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - **Step 5.1**: Compile the count into a JSON list.\n\nHere is the JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1.1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video file.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 1.2,\n        \"description\": \"Split the video into frames (e.g., 30 frames per second for a 10-second video would result in 300 frames).\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 2.1,\n        \"description\": \"Use a scene detection algorithm to identify different scenes in the video.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 2.2,\n        \"description\": \"Segment the video into scenes based on the detected boundaries.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 3.1,\n        \"description\": \"For each scene, use an action recognition model to identify actions occurring in the scene.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 3.2,\n        \"description\":", "grounder_response": "[0.0, 0.17, 0.83, 0.83]", "model_pred_first": "B", "model_pred": "B", "is_retry": true}, {"source": "mlvu", "data_type": "multimodal", "video_path": "/HOME/nsccgz_zgchen/nsccgz_zgchen_6/HDD_POOL/veot/datasets/mlvu/video/4_count/count_197.mp4", "query": "In this video, how many instances are there of the 'baking cookies' action scene in total?", "question": "In this video, how many instances are there of the 'baking cookies' action scene in total?", "options": ["4", "0", "3", "5"], "answer": "5", "ans": "D", "task": "count", "planner_response": "To plan the steps to answer the question \"In this video, how many instances are there of the 'baking cookies' action scene in total?\" for a video that is 10.0 seconds long, we can break down the process into the following steps:\n\n1. **Video Analysis Setup**:\n   - Load the video file.\n   - Set up a video analysis tool or API that can detect and classify actions in the video.\n\n2. **Action Detection**:\n   - Use the video analysis tool to detect and classify actions in the video.\n   - Specifically, configure the tool to identify the \"baking cookies\" action.\n\n3. **Timestamp Collection**:\n   - Collect timestamps for each instance where the \"baking cookies\" action is detected.\n\n4. **Count Instances**:\n   - Count the number of instances where the \"baking cookies\" action is detected.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the result as a JSON list containing the number of instances.\n\nHere is a JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video file.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 2,\n        \"description\": \"Set up a video analysis tool or API to detect and classify actions in the video.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 3,\n        \"description\": \"Use the video analysis tool to detect and classify actions, specifically identifying the 'baking cookies' action.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 4,\n        \"description\": \"Collect timestamps for each instance where the 'baking cookies' action is detected.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 5,\n        \"description\": \"Count the number of instances where the 'baking cookies' action is detected.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 6,\n        \"description\": \"Format the result as a JSON list containing the number of instances.\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis JSON list outlines the steps required to answer the question accurately.", "grounder_response": "[0.0, 0.17, 0.83, 0.83]", "model_pred_first": "B", "model_pred": "B", "is_retry": true}, {"source": "mlvu", "data_type": "multimodal", "video_path": "/HOME/nsccgz_zgchen/nsccgz_zgchen_6/HDD_POOL/veot/datasets/mlvu/video/4_count/count_4.mp4", "query": "In this video, how many instances are there of the 'abseiling' action scene in total?", "question": "In this video, how many instances are there of the 'abseiling' action scene in total?", "options": ["2", "0", "5", "3"], "answer": "2", "ans": "A", "task": "count", "planner_response": "To plan the steps to answer the question \"In this video, how many instances are there of the 'abseiling' action scene in total?\" for a video that is 10.0 seconds long, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the Video**: Load the video into a video processing tool or software that can analyze the content frame by frame.\n\n2. **Define the Action**: Clearly define what constitutes an \"abseiling\" action scene.
