Cups**: Count the number of cups detected in each frame.\n5. **Aggregate Results**: Sum the counts from all frames to get the total number of cups that appear in the video.\n6. **Output the Result**: Format the result as a JSON list.\n\nHere is the JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video into a video processing tool or
