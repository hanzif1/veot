The output will be a JSON list that includes the number of polar bears seen in the video.\n\n### Steps to Answer the Question\n\n1. **Video Analysis Setup**:\n   - Load the video into a video analysis tool or software.\n   - Ensure the video analysis tool can detect and track objects, specifically polar bears.\n\n2. **Object Detection**:\n   - Use a pre-trained object detection model that can recognize polar bears.\n   - Run the object detection model on each frame of the video.\n\n3. **Tracking and Counting**:\n   - Track the detected polar bears across frames to ensure the same bear is not counted multiple times.\n   - Maintain a count of unique polar bears seen in the video.\n\n4. **Result Compilation**:\n   - Compile the final count of polar bears seen in the video.\n   - Format the result as a JSON list.\n\n### Example JSON Output\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"video_duration\": \"10.0s\",\n        \"number_of_polar_bears_seen\": 3\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Detailed Steps\n\n1. **Load the Video**:\n   - Use a video processing library (e.g., OpenCV) to load the video.\n   - Ensure the video is in a format that can be processed by the object detection model.\n\n2. **Initialize Object Detection Model**:\n   - Load a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) that can recognize polar bears.\n   - Configure the model to run on each frame of the video.\n\n3. **Process Each Frame**:\n   - Iterate through each frame of the video.\n   - Apply the object detection model to each frame to detect polar bears.\n   - Store the bounding boxes and confidence scores of detected polar bears.\n\n4. **Track Polar Bears**:\n   - Use a tracking algorithm (e.g., Kalman filter, DeepSORT) to track the detected polar bears across frames.\n   - Ensure that the same polar bear is not counted multiple times by maintaining a unique identifier for each bear.\n\n5. **Count Unique Polar Bears**:\n   - After processing all frames, compile a list of unique polar bears.\n   - Count the number of unique polar bears seen in the video.\n\n6. **Generate JSON Output**:\n   - Create a JSON", "grounder_response": "How many polar bears are visible/seen in the

**Identify Key Visual Elements**: Look for specific details such as architecture, decor, people, activities, and background.\n3. **Listen for Audio Cues**: Pay attention to sounds that can provide context, such as music, ambient noise, or dialogue.\n4. **List Possible Venue Types**: Based on the visual and auditory cues, list the most likely venue types.\n5. **Evaluate Each Venue Type**: Compare the observed elements with the characteristics of each venue type.\n6. **Select the Most Likely Venue**: Determine which venue type best matches the context of the scene.\n7. **Format the

conference room, theater.\n5. **Evaluate Each Venue Type**:\n   - **Concert Hall**: Matches the presence of a stage and classical music.\n   - **Restaurant**: Less likely due to the formal setting and
