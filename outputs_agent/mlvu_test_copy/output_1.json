steps to answer the question \"What character appears the most in the video?\" for a 10-second video, we need to break down the process into several key steps.

**Character Detection**: Use a character detection model to identify and label characters in each frame.\n\n3. **Character Tracking**: Track the characters across frames to ensure continuity and accuracy in counting.\n\n4. **Character Counting**: Count the occurrences of each character across all frames.\n\n5. **Determine the Most Frequent Character**: Identify the character with the highest
