frames from the video. Since the video is 10 seconds long, you might want to extract frames at regular intervals (e.g., every second) to ensure you capture the entire video.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection

"To plan the steps to answer the question \"How many people are involved in the video?\" for a video that is 10 seconds long, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the Video**: Load the video file into a video processing library or tool.\n2. **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from the video. Since the video is only 10 seconds long, you can extract frames at a reasonable interval (e.g., every second or every half-second) to ensure you capture all potential people.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify people in each frame. Common models for this task include YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detection), or a pre-trained model from a library like OpenCV or TensorFlow.\n4. **Track People**: Track the detected people across frames to ensure that the same person is not counted multiple times. This can be done using tracking algorithms like SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) or DeepSORT.\n5. **Count Unique People**: Count the number of unique people identified across all frames.\n6. **Output the Result**: Format the result as a JSON list.\n\nHere is a JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video file into
