Since the video is 10 seconds long, you might want to extract frames at regular intervals (e.g., every second) to ensure you capture the entire video.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify and count people in each frame.\n4. **Track People**: Use object tracking to ensure that the same person is not counted multiple times across different frames.\n5. **Count People**: Aggregate the results to determine the total number of unique people in the video.\n6. **Output the Result**: Format the result as a JSON list.\n\nHere is a JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video file into a video processing library or tool.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 2,\n

from the video. Since the video is only 10 seconds long, you can extract frames at a reasonable rate (e.g., one frame per second).\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify and count children in each frame. You can use pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or a custom model trained on a dataset that includes children.\n4. **Track and Count**: Track the detected children across frames to ensure that the same child is not counted multiple times.

**Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from the video at regular intervals (e.g., every second) to ensure you have a representative sample of the video content.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object

frames from the video. Since the video is only 10 seconds long, you can extract frames at a reasonable interval (e.g., every second or every half-second) to ensure you capture all potential people.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify people in each frame. This can be done using pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.\n4. **Track People**: Use object tracking to follow the detected people across frames. This helps in distinguishing between different individuals and avoids counting the same person multiple times.\n5. **Count Unique People**: Aggregate the tracking data to count the number of unique
