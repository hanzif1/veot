Extraction**: Extract frames from the video at regular intervals (e.g., every 0.5 seconds) to ensure you capture the entire 10-second duration.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model

**Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify and count babies in each frame. This can be done using pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or a custom model trained on baby images.\n4. **Count Aggregation**: Aggregate the counts from each frame to determine the total number of unique babies in the video.

frames from the video. Since the video is 10 seconds long, you might want to extract frames at regular intervals (e.g., every second or every half-second) to ensure you capture all relevant moments.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify ducks in each frame. This can be done using pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Mask R-CNN.\n4. **Counting Ducks**: Count the number of ducks detected in each frame.\n5. **Aggregation**: Aggregate the counts to determine the total number of unique ducks involved in the video.

for a video that is 10 seconds long, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the Video**: Load the video file into a video processing library or tool.\n2. **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from the video. Since the video is 10 seconds long, you might want to extract frames at regular intervals (e.g., every second) to ensure you capture the entire video.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify and count people in each frame.\n4. **Track People**: Optionally, use object tracking to ensure that the same person is not counted multiple times across different frames.\n5.

question \"How many adults are in the video?\" for a video that is 10 seconds long, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the Video**: Load the video into a video processing tool or software that can analyze frame-by-frame.\n\n2. **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from the video. Since the video is 10 seconds long, you might want to extract frames at regular intervals (e.g., every second) to ensure you cover the entire video without overloading the system.\n\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify people in each frame. Models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detection), or a custom model trained on human detection can be used.\n\n4. **Age Estimation**: For each detected person, use an age estimation model to determine if they are adults. Age estimation models can classify individuals into age groups (e.g., child, adult, senior).\n\n5. **Counting Adults**: Count the number of detected individuals classified as adults in each frame.\n\n6. **Aggregation**: Aggregate the counts across all frames to get a final count of adults in the video. You might want to use a threshold to avoid double-counting the same person in different frames.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: Format the result as a JSON list.\n\nHere is a JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video into a video processing tool or software.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 2,\n        \"description\":
