is 10 seconds long, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Load the Video**: Load the video into a video processing tool or software that can analyze the content frame by frame.\n2. **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from the video at regular intervals (e.g., every second or every half-second) to ensure you capture all potential appearances of men.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify and count the number of men in each frame. This can be done using pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or a custom model trained on human detection.\n4. **Track Individuals**: Use object tracking to ensure that the same person is not counted multiple times across different frames.\n5. **Aggregate Results**: Combine the results from all frames to get the total number of unique men in the video.\n6. **Output the Result**: Format the result as a JSON list.\n\nHere is a JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video into a video processing tool or software.\"\n

Since the video is only 10 seconds long, you can extract frames at a reasonable rate (e.g., one frame per second).\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify and count the number of boys in each frame. You can use pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.\n4. **Consolidate Results**: Combine the results from all frames to get a final count of boys. You can use techniques like non-max suppression or tracking to avoid counting the same boy multiple times.\n5. **Output the Result**: Format the result as a JSON list.\n\nHere is the JSON list

Extraction**: Extract frames from the video. Since the video is only 10 seconds long, you might want to extract frames at a reasonable interval (e.g., every second or every half-second) to ensure you capture all potential instances of children.\n3. **Object Detection**: Use an object detection model to identify and count children in each frame. This can be done using pre-trained models like YOLO, SSD, or a custom model trained on a dataset of children.\n4. **Track and Count**: Track the detected children across frames to avoid counting the same child multiple times. This can be done using object tracking algorithms.\n5. **Aggregate Results**: Combine the results from all frames to get the total number of unique children in the video.\n6. **Output the Result**: Format the result as a JSON list.\n\nHere is the JSON list representing the steps:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"description\": \"Load the video into a video processing tool or
