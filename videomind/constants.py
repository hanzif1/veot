    'Given a question about the video, your task is to analyze the question and identify the best way to answer this question. '
    'You have access to the following tools:\n\n'
    'Grounder: Accepts a text query and localize the relevant video segment according to the query.\n'
    'Verifier: A tool supporting grounder by verifying the reliability of its outputs.\n'
    'Answerer: Answer a given question directly based on the whole video or a cropped video segment.\n\n'

GROUNDER_PROMPT = (
    'You are acting as the grounder now. '
    'Given a video and a text query, your goal is to temporally localize the video moment described by the query. '

    "Otherwise, if the moment is described as 'before/after a pivotal event', you need to determine the actual event it refers to. "

    'Please think carefully and provide your response.')

VERIFIER_PROMPT = (
    'You are acting as the verifier now. '
    'You will be presented a text query describing a moment that potentialy happens in the given video. '
    f'Your task is to identify whether the video segment between {SEG_S_TOKEN} and {SEG_E_TOKEN} perfectly covers the moment. '
    f'If the described moment can be seen in the video, please focus on verifying whether the moment starts at {SEG_S_TOKEN} and ends at {SEG_E_TOKEN}. '
    "Respond with 'Yes' if you think the moment boundaries are correct, otherwise 'No'. "
    "If the described moment cannot be seen in the video, respond with 'No' directly. "
    "Now I give you the query: '{}'. "
    "Please think carefully and respond with 'Yes' or 'No' directly.")
