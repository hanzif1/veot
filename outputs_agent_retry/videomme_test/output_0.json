Record the time stamps for each event to ensure accuracy.\n3. **Order the Events**: Based on the time stamps, determine the sequence of the events.\n4. **Format the Answer**: Present the order of

Execute:\n\n1. **Watch the Video**:\n   - Play the video and pay close attention to the sequence of events.\n   - Note any visual cues or transitions that indicate the start and end of each event.\n\n2. **Note the Time Stamps**:\n   - For each event, pause the video and note the exact time it occurs.\n   - For example:\n     - A coin jumps from hand to hand: 0:02\n     - A ring jumps into the finger: 0:05\n     - The cigarette disappears and reappears: 0:07\n     - A coin changes into a card: 0:09\n\n3. **Order the Events**:\n   - Use the time stamps to determine the sequence of

Example Execution:\n\n1. **Watch the Video**:\n   - Play the 10-second video and observe the events.\n\n2. **Note the Time Stamps**:\n   - A coin jumps from hand to hand: 0:02\n   - A ring jumps into the finger: 0:05\n   - The cigarette disappears and reappears: 0:07\n   - A coin changes into a card: 0:09\n\n3.", "grounder_response": "[0.3, 0.21, 0.69, 0.76]", "model_pred_first": "C",

Note the time or sequence when \"How to create a winning hand\" (d) is mentioned.\n3. **Sequence the Points**: Arrange the topics in the order they appear.\n4. **Format the Answer**: Convert the sequence into a JSON list.\n\nBy following these steps, you can accurately determine the sequence of the contents introduced in the video and provide the required JSON list.", "grounder_response": "[0.27, 0.65, 0.73, 0.73]", "model_pred_first": "A", "model_pred": "A", "is_retry": false}, {"source": "videomme", "data_type": "multimodal", "video_path": "/HOME/nsccgz_zgchen/nsccgz_zgchen_6/HDD_POOL/veot/datasets/videomme/videos/lVeNTofDB2k.mp4", "query": "Which of the following item is not the difference when making Macchiato and Latte Macchiato according to the video?", "question": "Which of the following item is not the difference when making Macchiato and Latte Macchiato according to the video?", "options": ["Different types of coffee.", "Different kinds of cups.", "Different tainting strategies.", "None of the above."], "answer": "Different types of coffee.", "ans": "A", "task": "long", "planner_response": "```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"action\": \"Watch the video carefully, paying attention to the preparation methods of both Macchiato and Latte Macchiato.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 2,\n        \"action\": \"Identify the key steps and ingredients used in making both drinks.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 3,\n        \"action\": \"List the differences noted between the preparation of Macchiato and Latte Macchiato.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 4,\n        \"action\": \"Compare the listed differences with the options provided in the question.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 5,\n        \"action\": \"Identify the option that is not a difference between the two drinks based on the video.\"\n    }\n]\n```", "grounder_response": "[0.5, 0.21, 0.74, 0.72]", "model_pred_first": "D", "model_pred": "D", "is_retry": false}, {"source": "videomme", "data_type": "multimodal", "video_path": "/HOME/nsccgz_zgchen/nsccgz_zgchen_6/HDD_POOL/veot/datasets/videomme/videos/MYxL_JLseC8.mp4", "query": "What is the central content of the video?", "question": "What is the central content of the video?", "options": ["A professor is giving a speech online on how to design and build your outdoor kitchen.", "A professor is discussing in the office with his students how to design and build your outdoor kitchen.", "A professor is teaching a class in the classroom on how to design and build your outdoor kitchen.", "None of the above."], "answer": "A professor is giving a speech online on how to design and build your outdoor kitchen.", "ans": "A", "task": "long", "planner_response": "```json\n[\n    {\n        \"step\": 1,\n        \"action\": \"Watch the video in its entirety, paying close attention to visual and auditory elements.\",\n        \"description\": \"Since the video is only 10 seconds long, it can be watched in full to capture all the details.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 2,\n        \"action\": \"Identify key visual elements.\",\n        \"description\": \"Note any prominent images, actions, or scenes that stand out in the video.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 3,\n        \"action\": \"Listen for any spoken words, music, or sound effects.\",\n        \"description\": \"Pay attention to any dialogue, narration, or background sounds that provide context or meaning.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 4,\n        \"action\": \"Summarize the main message or theme.\",\n        \"description\": \"Combine the visual and auditory elements to determine the central content or message of the video.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"step\": 5,\n        \"action\": \"Formulate a concise answer.\",\n        \"description\": \"Write a clear and concise statement that captures the central content of the video.\"\n    }\n]\n```", "grounder_response": "[0.0, 0.21, 0.82, 0.8]", "model_pred_first": "D", "model_pred": "D", "is_retry": false}, {"source": "videomme", "data_type": "multimodal", "video_path": "/HOME/nsccgz_zgchen/nsccgz_zgchen_6/HDD_POOL/veot/datasets/videomme/videos/B0-7MeWA2aI.mp4", "query": "In which order are the following topics introduced in this video?
