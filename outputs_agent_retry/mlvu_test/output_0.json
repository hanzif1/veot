**Baseline Comparison:** Compare the detected objects and their behaviors to a baseline of normal activity.\n   - **Rule-Based Detection:** Apply predefined rules to identify irregularities, such as:\n     - Unexpected presence of objects or people.\n     - Abnormal movement patterns (e.g., running in a restricted area).\n     - Sudden changes in the environment (e.g., a door opening unexpectedly).\n\n4. **Result Compilation:**\n   - Compile the findings into a structured format, including the type of irregularity, the time it occurred, and a brief description.\n\n5. **Output JSON List:**\n   - Format the results as a JSON list, where each entry represents an identified irregularity.\n\n### Example JSON Output\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"time\": \"00:02\",\n
