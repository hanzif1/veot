performed.\n\n2. **Identify Action Scenes**: Note the start and end times of each instance where the action of making jewelry is visible.\n\n3. **Count the Instances**: Count the total number of distinct instances where the action of making jewelry is performed.\n\n4. **Format the Output**: Compile the count into a JSON list.\n\nHere is the JSON list format for the output:\n\n```json\n[\n

Each step is designed to systematically process the video and identify any anomalies present. The output will be a JSON list summarizing the findings.\n\n### Steps to Analyze Surveillance Footage for Anomalies\n\n1. **Preprocessing the Video**:\n   - **Step 1.1**: Load the video file.\n   - **Step 1.2**: Convert the video into a sequence of frames.\n   - **Step 1.3**: Apply any necessary preprocessing (e.g., resizing, normalization).\n\n2. **Feature Extraction**:\n   - **Step 2.1**: Use a pre-trained model to extract features from each frame.\n   - **Step 2.2**: Optionally, extract motion vectors or optical flow to capture movement patterns.\n\n3. **Anomaly Detection**:\n   - **Step 3.1**: Apply an anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., autoencoder, clustering, or rule-based methods) to identify frames that deviate from the norm.\n   - **Step 3.2**: Classify the type of anomaly (e.g., sudden movement, object appearance/disappearance, unusual behavior).\n\n4. **Post-processing and Validation**:\n   - **Step 4.1**: Filter out false positives using context or additional rules.\n   - **Step 4.2**: Validate the detected anomalies by reviewing the frames or segments.\n\n5. **Generate Output**:\n   - **Step 5.1**: Compile the results into a JSON list.\n   - **Step 5.2**: Include the timestamp of the anomaly, the type of anomaly, and any additional relevant information.\n\n### JSON Output Example\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"timestamp\": 2.5,\n        \"anomaly_type\": \"sudden_movement\",\n        \"description\": \"A person suddenly appears in the frame.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"timestamp\": 7.0,\n        \"anomaly_type\": \"object_disappearance\",\n        \"description\": \"A bag disappears from the frame.\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n### Detailed Plan\n\n1. **Preprocessing the Video**:\n   - **Step 1.1**: Load the video file using a video processing library (e.g., OpenCV).\n   - **Step 1.2**: Convert the video into a sequence of frames at a suitable frame rate (e.g., 30 FPS).\n   - **Step 1.3", "grounder_response":
